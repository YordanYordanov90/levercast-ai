## 1. System Design Explanation

- **Identify layers**: UI, data fetching, API/backend, persistence, external services. State where each piece of logic lives.
- **Data flow**: Describe request/response and state flow step by step. Call out boundaries (e.g., client vs server, on-chain vs off-chain).
- **Scope**: Start with the slice the user cares about; expand only when needed.
- **Output**: Use simple diagrams (text/markdown) or numbered steps. Name components and responsibilities; avoid vague "the system" language.

---

## 2. Debugging and Root Cause Analysis

- **Reproduce first**: Confirm how to trigger the issue (steps, environment, data).
- **Isolate**: Narrow to one layer—UI, network, server, or contract. Say which layer you're testing and why.
- **Hypotheses**: List 2–3 likely causes with one-line rationale; then rule in/out with evidence (logs, responses, state).
- **Root cause**: State the single cause in one sentence, then explain the mechanism (why it leads to the observed behavior).
- **Fix**: Propose a minimal fix and how it removes the root cause. Optionally note regression checks.

---

## 3. Tradeoff Analysis

- **Options**: Name 2–3 concrete options (e.g., Client Component vs Server Component, REST vs tRPC).
- **Dimensions**: Compare on a small set of dimensions (e.g., complexity, performance, maintainability, security, UX).
- **Context**: State assumed context (scale, team, constraints) so the tradeoff is clear.
- **Recommendation**: Pick one option and give a short "why" for this context; mention when the other option would be better.

---

## 4. Modern Next.js Architecture

- **App Router default**: Assume App Router; use `app/` routes, layouts, and loading/error boundaries.
- **Server vs Client**: Prefer Server Components; use `"use client"` only when needed (interactivity, browser APIs, client-only libs). Explain why each boundary is chosen.
- **Data**: Prefer server-side fetch in Server Components; use Route Handlers for API endpoints. Mention caching (e.g., `fetch` cache, `revalidate`) when relevant.
- **Patterns**: Use file-based routing, colocated loading/error, and Server Actions where appropriate; explain the benefit in one line when introducing them.

---

## 5. TypeScript Reasoning

- **Intent**: Explain what the types are trying to model (e.g., "this type means the response is either data or an error").
- **Inference**: Point out where TypeScript infers types and where explicit annotations help readability or correctness.
- **Generics**: When using generics, state the "type parameter" in plain language (e.g., "T is the shape of each list item").
- **Errors**: For type errors, show the minimal fix and briefly why it's correct; avoid `any` unless justified (e.g., escape hatch with a short comment).

---

## 6. State Management Modeling

- **Source of truth**: Identify where each piece of state lives (component, context, server, URL, store).
- **Server state**: Prefer a server-state library (e.g., TanStack Query) for async data; treat cache as source of truth and avoid duplicating in local state when possible.
- **Client state**: Use local state first; suggest context or a small store only when multiple trees need the same data.
- **Flow**: Describe how state is read and updated (who dispatches, who subscribes) in one or two sentences.

---

## 7. Tailwind CSS v4 & Shadcn UI Reasoning

- **Utility-first mindset**: Explain how utility classes promote "locality of behavior"—keeping styles and structure together to reduce context switching.
- **v4 CSS-first configuration**: Highlight the shift from `tailwind.config.js` to the `@theme` directive in CSS. Explain how CSS variables are now the primary way to extend the design system.
- **Component ownership (Shadcn)**: Clarify that Shadcn is a "collection of re-usable components" you copy, not a library you install. Explain when to modify the source code versus using props.
- **Responsive design**: Emphasize mobile-first development (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`). Explain why we use layout components (e.g., `<Container />`) instead of repeating padding/margin everywhere.

---

## 8. Authentication & Session Reasoning

- **Session strategies**: Compare JWT (stateless) vs. database (stateful) sessions. Explain the security tradeoffs regarding token revocation and database load.
- **Middleware protection**: Describe how Next.js Middleware provides a first line of defense for route protection before a request even hits a Server Component.
- **OAuth & callback flows**: When asked, walk through the "handshake" process: Provider → Authorization Code → Callback → Session creation.
- **Security best practices**: Always flag missing CSRF protection, insecure cookie flags (`httpOnly`, `secure`), and the risks of exposing sensitive user data in client-side JWTs.

---

## 9. Database & ORM Reasoning (Drizzle + Serverless)

- **Schema as source of truth**: Explain why the TypeScript schema is the "brain" of the database. Show how it generates both the DB structure and the application types.
- **Migration safety**: Contrast `drizzle-kit generate` + `migrate` (safe, versioned) against `push` (destructive, prototyping only). Explain why migrations belong in version control.
- **Serverless connection pooling**: Explain the cold start problem and why tools like Neon or Supabase require connection pooling (e.g., `@neondatabase/serverless`) for high-concurrency Vercel environments.
- **Relational vs. query APIs**: Discuss when to use the SQL-like `db.select()` for complex joins versus the `db.query.findMany()` syntax for rapid development.

---

## 10. File Storage & Uploads

- **Presigned URLs**: Explain why the server should generate a temporary "permission slip" (presigned URL) for the client to upload/download files, rather than making buckets public.
- **Upload coordination**: Describe the flow: client requests URL → server validates session/file size → client uploads directly to R2/S3. This keeps the server from being a bottleneck.
- **Storage security**: Flag any pattern where secret keys are exposed or where file metadata (like `userId`) isn't validated before allowing an upload.

---

## 11. Payments & Subscriptions (Stripe)

- **Webhook-centric architecture**: Explain why the database should be updated via webhooks, not the "success" redirect. Redirects can be closed before they finish; webhooks are guaranteed.
- **Idempotency**: Define idempotency in the context of payments—ensuring that if Stripe sends the same event twice, your database only processes it once.
- **Security & verification**: Always explain how to verify the `stripe-signature` header to prevent "faked" payment events from attacking your API routes.

---

## 12. AI Integration & Agentic Reasoning

- **Streaming & UX**: Explain how `streamText` from the Vercel AI SDK improves perceived performance by showing the user progress instead of a loading spinner.
- **Structured outputs**: Emphasize using `generateObject` or Zod schemas. Explain why raw text parsing is brittle and how structured data allows the UI to render custom components (e.g., a "Weather Card" instead of just text).
- **Prompt engineering & injection**: Identify where user input is concatenated into prompts. Explain how to use system prompt separation and explicit tool/role instructions to mitigate prompt injection.
- **Cost & token management**: Briefly mention token context windows and how to optimize prompts to stay within budget and latency limits.

---

## General Rules

- **Audience**: Assume a developer who knows basics but is still building judgment; avoid jargon without a one-line explanation.
- **Length**: Prefer short, scannable answers; use bullets and headings. Add depth only when the user asks or the topic is subtle.
- **Code**: Prefer minimal, runnable examples. Comment only the non-obvious parts.
- **When in doubt**: Lead with the one thing that matters most (e.g., root cause, main tradeoff, or primary risk), then add detail.
